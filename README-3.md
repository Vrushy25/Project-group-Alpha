Objective:
Design a database structure for your system, ensuring it is normalized, efficient, and scalable.
Instructions:
1.	Create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):
Step 1: Identify Entities and Their Attributes
To design an efficient database, we must first identify the key entities (tables) that represent different components of the system. Let's assume we are designing a Skill-Bridge platform, which connects professionals with companies for short-term projects, internships, or mentorship programs.
Entities and Their Attributes
1.	Users (stores information about users, including professionals and recruiters)
o	user_id (PK, Unique ID for each user)
o	first_name
o	last_name
o	email (Unique)
o	password
o	user_type (ENUM: ‚ÄòProfessional‚Äô, ‚ÄòRecruiter‚Äô)
o	created_at (Timestamp)
2.	Profiles (stores additional details about professionals)
o	profile_id (PK)
o	user_id (FK)
o	bio
o	skills (Text format, comma-separated or JSON)
o	experience_level (ENUM: ‚ÄòBeginner‚Äô, ‚ÄòIntermediate‚Äô, ‚ÄòExpert‚Äô)
o	linkedin_url
3.	Companies (stores information about recruiters' companies)
o	company_id (PK)
o	company_name
o	industry
o	location
o	website
4.	Projects (short-term skill-based tasks posted by recruiters)
o	project_id (PK)
o	company_id (FK)
o	title
o	description
o	required_skills (Text format, JSON)
o	budget
o	status (ENUM: ‚ÄòOpen‚Äô, ‚ÄòClosed‚Äô, ‚ÄòIn Progress‚Äô)
o	created_at (Timestamp)
5.	Applications (tracks applications submitted by professionals)
o	application_id (PK)
o	project_id (FK)
o	user_id (FK)
o	cover_letter
o	status (ENUM: ‚ÄòPending‚Äô, ‚ÄòAccepted‚Äô, ‚ÄòRejected‚Äô)
o	applied_at (Timestamp)
6.	Reviews (stores feedback and ratings for professionals)
o	review_id (PK)
o	reviewer_id (FK, refers to user_id of recruiter)
o	professional_id (FK, refers to user_id of professional)
o	rating (1-5 scale)
o	comments
o	reviewed_at (Timestamp)

Step 2: Establish Relationships Between Entities
Now, let's define the relationships between these entities:
‚Ä¢	Users and Profiles ‚Üí One-to-One (One user has one profile)
‚Ä¢	Users and Companies ‚Üí One-to-Many (A recruiter can belong to one company, but a company can have many recruiters)
‚Ä¢	Companies and Projects ‚Üí One-to-Many (A company can post multiple projects)
‚Ä¢	Users and Projects (via Applications) ‚Üí Many-to-Many (Professionals apply to multiple projects, and a project receives multiple applications)
‚Ä¢	Users and Reviews ‚Üí One-to-Many (A professional can receive multiple reviews from different recruiters)

Step 3: Create the ER Diagram
 










2.	Define Database Tables:

Below are the SQL table definitions for each entity in the Skill-Bridge system. The database design follows normalization principles, including 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.

1. Users Table
Stores information about users (both professionals and recruiters).

CREATE DATABASE SkillBridge;

USE SkillBridge; 

-- Create the Users table
CREATE TABLE Users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,  -- Unique ID for each user (Primary Key)
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,         -- First Name (not null constraint)
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,          -- Last Name (not null constraint)
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,      -- Email (unique and not null)
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,          -- Password (store hashed values)
    user_type ENUM('Professional', 'Recruiter') NOT NULL,  -- User type (Enum with two options)
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  -- Timestamp when the user is created
);
SCREENSHOT OF TABLES AND OUTPUT:
 

CREATE TABLE Profiles (

    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES Companies(company_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

 



CREATE TABLE Applications (
    application_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,  -- Unique application ID
    project_id INT,                                -- Foreign Key to Projects table
    user_id INT,                                   -- Foreign Key to Users table
    cover_letter TEXT,
    status ENUM('Pending', 'Accepted', 'Rejected') NOT NULL,
    applied_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES Projects(project_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

 

CREATE TABLE Reviews (

    professional_id INT,                       -- Foreign Key to Users table (Professional)
    rating INT CHECK(rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5),   -- Rating between 1 and 5
    comments TEXT,
    reviewed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (reviewer_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (professional_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

 

3.	Provide Sample Queries:

‚Ä¢	Admin Class (inherits from User)
‚Ä¢ Attributes: adminID, adminName
‚Ä¢ Methods: manageUsers(), approveCourseContent(), viewReports()
Step 3: Define Relationships
‚Ä¢	Learner enrolls in Courses ‚Üí Association (many-to-many: A learner can enroll in multiple courses, and a course can have multiple learners)
‚Ä¢	Course is taught by Instructor ‚Üí Association (one-to-many: An instructor can create multiple courses)
‚Ä¢	Course contains Modules ‚Üí Aggregation (one course can have multiple modules)
‚Ä¢	Learner completes Assessments in Courses ‚Üí Association (many-to-many: A learner can complete many assessments, and an assessment can be taken by many learners)
‚Ä¢	Assessment is part of a Course ‚Üí Association (one-to-many: A course can have multiple assessments)
‚Ä¢	Learner receives Certification for a Course ‚Üí Association (one-to-one: A learner receives one certification for completing a course)
‚Ä¢	Admin manages Users, Courses, and Assessments ‚Üí Association
‚Ä¢	Admin is a type of User ‚Üí Inheritance (Generalization)



3. Develop a Sequence Diagram:
A Sequence Diagram visually represents interactions between system components over time. It details how different objects communicate to accomplish a task.
For SkillBridge, we will focus on two key functionalities:
1.	User Registration
2.	Course Enrollment

Step 1: Identify Key Participants
Each functionality involves specific actors (users interacting with the system) and objects (system components processing requests).
1. User Registration
‚Ä¢	Actors: User (Learner or Instructor)
‚Ä¢	Objects:
o	Registration Interface (UI)
o	Authentication Module
o	Database
2. Course Enrollment
‚Ä¢	Actors: Learner
‚Ä¢	Objects:
o	Learner Dashboard (UI)
o	Course Management System
o	Payment Gateway (if applicable)
o	Database

Step 2: Define Interaction Flow
1. User Registration Process
1.	The User accesses the registration page.
2.	The User submits details like name, email, password, and role.
3.	The Registration Interface forwards the data to the Authentication Module.
4.	The Authentication Module validates the details.
5.	It checks the Database for existing users.
6.	If the user is new, the Database stores the details.
7.	The Authentication Module confirms registration.
8.	The Registration Interface displays a success message.
Interactions:
User ‚Üí Registration Interface ‚Üí Authentication Module ‚Üí Database

2. Course Enrollment Process
1.	The Learner logs in and browses available courses.
2.	The Learner selects a course and clicks "Enroll".
3.	The Learner Dashboard sends an enrollment request to the Course Management System.
4.	The Course Management System checks course availability.
5.	If payment is needed, the Payment Gateway processes the transaction.
6.	Upon successful payment, the Course Management System registers the learner in the Database.
7.	The Course Management System sends an enrollment confirmation.
8.	The Learner Dashboard displays a success message.
Interactions:
Learner ‚Üí Learner Dashboard ‚Üí Course Management System ‚Üí Payment Gateway (if needed) ‚Üí Database


4.Create an Activity Diagram:
An Activity Diagram visually represents the workflow of a process in the system. For SkillBridge, we will illustrate the Course Enrollment & Payment Process as an activity diagram.

Step 3: Activity Diagram:
Step 1: Outline the Main Stages of the Process
The Course Enrollment & Payment Process consists of the following stages:
1.	The learner browses and selects a course from the course catalog.
2.	The system determines whether the course is free or paid.
o	If the course is free, the learner is immediately enrolled.
o	If the course is paid, the process moves to the payment stage.
3.	The learner chooses a payment method (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal).
4.	The learner enters and submits payment details.
5.	The Payment Gateway processes the transaction.
6.	If payment is successful, the learner is enrolled in the course.
o	If the payment fails, the learner is prompted to retry or select another payment method.
7.	The system confirms enrollment and grants the learner access to course materials.

Step 2: Visualizing the Workflow in an Activity Diagram
Key Components to Include:
‚Ä¢	Start Node: Indicates the initiation of the process.
‚Ä¢	Actions: Represent tasks such as course selection, payment processing, and confirmation.
‚Ä¢	Decision Nodes: Handle conditions like Free vs. Paid Course and Payment Success vs. Failure.
‚Ä¢	Final Node: Marks the completion of the process.
